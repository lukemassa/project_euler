## project euler

Code for as I progress through https://projecteuler.net/

Note that I typically don't save a given solution, only save functions I write as I go that might be useful later.

Per https://projecteuler.net/about, it's "ok" to share solutions to the first 100 problems, so despite these only being "partial" solutions, I'll stop pushing to this repo once/if I hit 100 :)
